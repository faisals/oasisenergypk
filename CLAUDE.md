# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a minimal project for Oasis Energy PK containing only image assets. Currently, the repository consists of:
- 5 carousel images in the `/imgs/` directory (carousel-01.jpeg through carousel-05.jpeg)

## Development Notes

As this project currently contains only image assets with no code, configuration files, or build system, there are no specific commands or architecture to document at this time.

When the project expands to include actual application code, this file should be updated with:
- Build and development commands
- Project architecture and structure
- Testing procedures
- Deployment processes
