# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Landing page for Oasis Energy.
This will be a landing page in the following stack:
- Plain HTML5
- Tailwind CDN for styling
- A 15-line vanilla JS file for UX sugar
- Will be hosted on Netlify with a custom domain
- Forms	Netlify Forms (automatic detection)
- E‑mail alerts	Netlify “Form notifications” 
- Custom domain	Bring your domain, delegate DNS to Netlify or leave DNS where it is and add an A+CNAME record

## Development Notes

As this project uses plain HTML with Tailwind CDN, there are no build steps required. Simply open the HTML files in a browser for local development.

## Deployment

The site is configured for deployment on Netlify with a custom domain (oasisenergypk.com).
